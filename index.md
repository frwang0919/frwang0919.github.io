## Selected Business Analytics Projects

### üîã Monte Carlo Profit Simulation | Enterprise Risk Analytics
Conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate profit outcomes for an electric motorboat startup. Visualized results with ribbon plots showing mean profit and 80%/99% prediction intervals, and density plots illustrating profit distributions across production levels.

- Language: R
- Tools: ggplot2, simulation modeling

### üíº Job Postings Analytics Using Spark | Web Analytics
The global job market is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by factors such as the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), evolving work models like remote work, and shifting wage structures across industries. In this project, I analyzed global job market trends using PySpark, focusing on salary patterns across careers. The study explored the impact of remote work, regional differences, and industry-specific dynamics on compensation, providing actionable insights to support informed career planning and workforce strategy development.

- Language: Python, SQL
- Tools: Spark, Plotly, Pandas

### ü¶û Lobsterland Consumer Insights | Marketing Analytics
Conducted in-depth marketing analytics for Lobsterland Park to uncover trends in customer behavior and sales performance. For example, I analyzed total sales volume fluctuations over time across different purchase channels to identify seasonal patterns and channel effectiveness. Additionally, I created a heatmap to visualize sales by product category and day of the week, revealing key insights into consumer preferences and peak purchasing times. These findings supported data-driven decisions in campaign targeting, inventory management, and operational planning.

- Language: Python
- Tools: Pandas, Seaborn

### üß† Classification Modeling on Passholder Data: ML with Grid Search Tuning, KNN Imputation, and Preprocessing Pipelines
The Lobsterland Passholder Project involved predicting 2025 season renewal behavior for park passholders based on demographic, behavioral, and categorical data.

I worked on this classification task using a range of ML techniques, including: (i) imputing missing values using KNN, (ii) modeling with Decision Trees and Random Forests, (iii) tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV, and (iv) analyzing feature importances to interpret the drivers of renewal behavior.

### üìà Regression Modeling and Model Evaluation
In this project, I built a regression model to predict salary levels using job postings data, incorporating features such as industry, experience, education, and remote work settings. The workflow included data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features within a preprocessing pipeline.

Model performance was evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R¬≤, alongside diagnostic plots to assess assumptions and model fit. These included residuals vs. fitted values, Q-Q plots, and distribution plots of residuals to detect patterns of non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, and potential outliers.
